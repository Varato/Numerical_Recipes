### Solving Resistor Network Problem by C

The source file ```resistor\_network.c``` requires the files in ../nrlib.
To compile ```resistor\_network.c```, just run the script ```./compile.sh```, or check the gcc command inside it.

After compilation, use the binary executable file by
```
./ResistorNetwork [L]
```
to solve L x L resistor network problem, where L is the number of resistors in one side of the network.
