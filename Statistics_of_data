what's the different between error and standard deviation?
<x> \pm \sigma / \sqrt{N}

###Higher Moments
Skewness -- third moment
Kurtosis -- forth moment
How much a distribution differs from standard Gaussian distribution
For standard Gaussian dist:
<x>=0
<x^2>=\sigma^2
<x^3>=0
<x^4>=3\sigma^4      % by Wick's theorem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wick%27s_theorem



X ~ N(u1, \sigma1)
Y ~ N(u2, \sigma2)
X+Y is still a Gaussian distribution
X^2+Y^2



chi^2 distribution & least square method

Your chi^2 cannot be too small. That's overfitting!!

###Linear Regression Model

e~N(0,\sigma) %How much the straight line differs from data points
<e>=0
<ei, ej>=\sigma^2\delta_{ij}

error is a random variable.
deviation is a number.

Error propagation
a, b
basic idea
Tylor expasion at <y_i>
