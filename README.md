###LinearSolver by C

Three directories are in this project.

In nrlib, there are some source files and header files from Numerical Recipes's [web](http://numerical.recipes/public-domain.html) and book, which are required by LUdecomp and ResistorNetwork.

In LUdecomp, the programe can solve a general linear system by LU decomposition.

In ResistorNetwork, the programe can solve the resistor network problem by modeling it as a linear system.
